                                                    magnificent palace. The whole complex has a total area of 28 acres and at one time had one of the best rose gardens of the country. Though simple to look from outside, the magnificent interior takes
                                                    one into a dreamland of past glory. Lavishly decorated in the style of Varsailles Palace, its Italian marble columns, grand chandeliers, rich Persian carpets, flying nymphs on the ceiling, Belgium stained

                                                    of the Holkars is built in a mixture of Maratha, Mughal and French style. The gopura-like monumental stone and wood structure, flanked by bastions and studded with balconies and windows, is a testimony
                                                    of the past grandeur of the Holkars. Its lofty entrance archway above a huge wooden door encrusted with iron studs, leads into a vast courtyard enclosed by galleried rooms, and the arcaded Ganesh Hall

                                                    was the most devastating. The charred rubble of the rear portion has now given way to a symmetrically laid out garden featuring fountains, an artificial waterfall and some superb pieces of eleventh century
