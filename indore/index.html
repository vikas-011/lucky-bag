                                                <p>Indore is a major city and commercial center of the state of Madhya Pradesh in central India. Indore is located 190 km west of state capital Bhopal. It serves as the headquarters of both the Indore district
                                                    and Indore division.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>During the days of the Maratha Empire it was an important halt between the Deccan and Delhi. However after the death of Madhavrao Peshwa, the Maratha Empire disintegrated and Indore was declared the capital
                                                    of the Holkar state, until Rani Ahilyabai Holkar moved the capital to Maheshwar.

                                                <p>Theories explaining the origins and etymology behind Indore's name differ. Formerly, the city of Indore was known by many different names. The first expected name of the city was Indreshwar which was named
                                                    after the Indreshwar Temple in the city. Before this name was used, it was known as Ahilyanagari (The city of Queen Ahilyabai Holkar). <br> Year 1607 to 1794 - Ahilyanagari,<br> Year 1800 to 1950 - Indhur,<br>                                                    Year 1958 till Present - Indore<br> TThe present name, Indore, originated from the Indreshwar temple constructed in 1741 by Ved Manuj. </p>
                                                <h4>History </h4>
                                                <p>The founders of Indore were the ancestors of the present zamindars of the region which spread from the banks of Narmada to the borders of Rajputana. Their headquarters were at a village called Kampel. In
                                                    Mughal times, the founders of these families received the title of Chaudhari, which established their claim to the land. In the 18th century, the control of Malwa passed to the Peshwa clan, and the Chaudharis
                                                    came to be known as "Mandloi"s (derived from Mandals meaning districts). The Holkars conferred the title of Rao Raja upon the family.The family retained its possessions of royalty, which included having
                                                    an elephant, Nishan, Danka and Gadi even after the advent of Holkars and also retained the right of performing the first puja of Dushera (Shami Pujan) before the Holkar rulers. </p>
                                                <p>Under Mughal rule, the family enjoyed great influence and was accorded confirmatory sanads by the Emperors Aurangzeb, Alamgir, and Farukhshayar, confirming their 'Jagir' rights. Rao Nandlal Chaudhary Zamindar,
                                                    upon visiting the court of Delhi, received a special place in the emperor’s court along with two jewel studded swords (now on display in the Royal British Museum under the family's name) and confirmatory
                                                    sanads. Raja Savai Jai singh of Jaipur, a personal friend of his, gifted him with a special "Gold Langar" which guaranteed a special place to him in all the Durbars of India. The family’s respectability
                                                    and influence over Malwa was instrumental in the ascent of the Peshwas and Holkars to rulership of this region.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Rao Nandlal Chaudhary, the founder of Indore, was the Chief Zamindar (landlord), and had an army of 2000 soldiers. In 1713, Nizam was appointed as the controller of the Deccan plateau area, which renewed
                                                    the struggle between the Marathas and the Mughals.</p>
                                                <p>While visiting the temple of Indreshwar near the banks of river Saraswati, Rao Nandlal found the location to be safe and strategically located, being surrounded by rivers on all sides. He started moving
                                                    his people in, and constructed the fort of Shree Sansthan Bada Rawala to protect them from harassment by Mughals. The city was named Indrapur (after Lord Indreshwar), and eventually came to be known
                                                    as Indore.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Baji Rao Peshwa finally took control of Malwa in 1733 A.D. Malhar Rao Holkar was one of the four signatories who guaranteed the proper fulfillment of the conditions.[10] Upon victory the Peshwas appointed
                                                    Malhar Rao Holkar as a “Subhedar”, which marked the beginning of Holkars' reign in Malwa. </p>
                                                <h4>Durbar Hall - Lal Bagh Palace</h4>
                                            </div>
                                            <div class="col-sm-8 no-padding">

                                                <p>Thus, Indore came to be ruled by the Maratha Maharajas of the Holkar dynasty. The dynasty's founder, Malhar Rao Holkar, (1694–1766), was granted control of Malwa Maratha armies in 1724, and in 1733, was
                                                    installed as the Maratha governor of the region. By the end of his reign, the Holkar state was de facto independent. He was succeeded by his daughter Ahilyabai Holkar who ruled from 1767 to 1795. She
                                                    ruled from a palace-fort at Maheshwar, south of Indore on the Narmada River. Ahilyabai Holkar was an architectural patron who donated money for the construction of Hindu temples across India. In 1818,
                                                    the Holkars were defeated by the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, and the Holkar kingdom became a part of the British Raj. </p>
